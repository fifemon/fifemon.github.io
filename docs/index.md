> "There's a dashboard for that!" (TM)

Fifemon is the FIFE project monitoring system developed and operated
by the User Support for Distrubuted Computing group at Fermilab.
Primarily this is monitoring the HTCondor pools, data handling and storage 
systems, and other related systems.

For an overview of Fifemon and many screenshots of the full deployment at Fermilab
please see [Kevin Retzke's talk from HTCondor Week 
2016](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2016/presentations/ThuRetzke_Fifemon.pdf).

We have made the generic probe scripts and generalized dashboards available for use
by the HEP, Open Science Grid, and wider HTCondor community on [GitHub](https://github.com/fifemon).
Scripts and dashboards are released only as time and effort permits on an 'as available' basis, 
and we look to the community for help in improving and expanding the application for general use.

Questions, comments, and open discussion are encouraged and should be directed to the fifemon@fnal.gov email list.
